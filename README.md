# Black Mage Eyes

This is a rewrite of Duke of Dummies' [Black Mage Eyes](https://github.com/dukeofdummies/BlackMageEyes), who's tutorials heavily helped me create my own mask. Thank you!

Code is NOT a drop-in replacement, however I made it easier for you to configure for your own application. (I will add explanations to the readme in the future:tm:).
